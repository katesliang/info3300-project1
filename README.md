# Streaming Platform Data Visualization
This project investigates shows on Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video using [this Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/netflix-prime-video-disney-hulu). 

Visualization 1 will tell us which streaming platforms have the best shows given the average iMDB and Rotten Tomatoes ratings each year in the dataset. 

Visualization 2 graphs the average rating of shows by target age group produced each year.
